# Safety Critical C++
## Minutes Repository

This repository contains minutes from meetings of the [Safety Critical C++ group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/safety-critical-cpp).

### Guidelines

- You don't need to record everything verbatim, but record the essence of each comment.
- The minute taker always has priority; it's not rude to interrupt if you need information or time.
  - If you don't know someone's name, interrupt and ask.
  - If you aren't sure that you captured or heard something correctly, interrupt and ask.
  - If you've fallen behind, interrupt and ask for a pause.
  - If you aren't ready to start, tell the chair; they'll wait.
- Always take attendance.
- Record polls verbatim; the specific wording is important.
- Use GitHub Flavored Markdown or [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
- Minutes should be named `YYYY_MM_DD__safety_critical[__optional_subject].{md,bs}`.
