RM: I believe MB had some comments for the group?

MB: I was at cppcon and this group did not start up as WG21 group

MB: why was Bryce Ready pushed aside from leading this?

MB: we should concentrate on safety critical systems not bikeshedding name

MB: RM email mentioned WG21 code of conduct which can be used...

RM: I was not at CppCon so I don't know. it's up to this group to decide what it wants.

AP: I was at cppcon, and that's an opinion. I think working with WG21 is required to make changes to the language.

AP: I don't think it's incompatible to discuss the problem and the solution via WG21.

MB: I don't think it's incompatible. We should work through MW's group.

MW: I think a group like this "proto study group" is for discussing problems that have bounced around a number of study groups

MW: We can't decide if this becomes a study group. We can request and justify and convener and chairs consider it.

MW: I'm working on safety coding standards (MISRA) on moving closer to C++

MW: If it becomes a study group the chair has to regularly attend ISO meetings

MW: I'm very interested inhearing what AW is saying

AW: slides from my cppnow presentation from last year

AW: we wished to use exceptions for error handling at BMW

AW: throwing side almost always mallocs with no customization point

AW: arbitrary number of types with arbitrary amount of memory

AW: unbounded number of exceptions can be alive

AW: how can you bad_alloc without heap? set aside a limited buffer on heap

AW: destructors can have their own nested exceptions

AW: patch runtime to hook into malloc?

AW: use fixed buffer? each throw could be potential terminate

AW: need to walk stack frame

AW: polymorphic catching requires all base classes: we have RTTI we can use

AW: this requires a lot of indirections over tables

AW: type information for all types, not just those handling execeptions

AW: type info structures can be expanded (ie. loading dll)

AW: it can be challenging to get deterministic runtimes

AW: RTTI is not required for implementation, but in practice they do

AW: set/long jump to unwind won't call destructors

AW: frame-based: runtime data structures of which destructors to call

AW: this is a lot of runtime work, extra binary instructions, and memory overhead

AW: but must compare to instruction overhead to manual error handling

AW: table-based: active local objects are known at compile time

AW: instruction pointer is lookup into table of live objects

AW: so long as no exception occurs then no overhead

AW: but if an exception occurs it's much harder to reconstruct destructor list

AW: binary size increase for tables

AW: frame-based better perf for frequent exceptions, table-based better for rare; both bloat binary

MW: do you know how many compilers implement table-based?

AW: afaik they all do -- windows 32 being the exception (use frame based)

MB: can you use table based exceptions across translation units?

AW: yes of course, it even works across dll boundaries,` as part of the ABI

AW: unwiding is driven by callee/thrower

AW: what if we shifted to caller/catcher?

AW: caller cleans up locally, and transfers control back to its caller, etc. (similar to call return)

AW: requires code insertion at every call site (ie. did you return-with-excpeton?)

AW: requires non-backward compatible ABI change

AW: probably worse perf, but more predictable

MW: I've been thinking about this, maybe you could use C++ attributes to mark the call chain? 

MW: You could use the stack to pass the unwind table?

AW: recompile-the-world is not scary for everyone

MW: I'm more concerned with ABI change, this is the problem with Herbceptions

AW: Herbceptions don't do it for all functions, but just ones marked -- which has different calling conventions for different functions

AW: memory limited (RAM/ROM) so it can be killer for small controllers

AW: RTTI is too wasteful

AW: restruct types that can be used as exceptions

AW: use unwind mechanism that favors size over speed

AW: just get a bigger controller...

AW: use custom routine for malloc

AW: restrict types and number of exceptions

AW: finding the matching catch at runtime is unpredictable / hard to reason about

AW: how useful is polymorphic catching?

AW: restricting exception types doesn't restrict information content

AW: how much information do we really need? single error code is probably enough

AW: why haven't exception analysis (time/space) tools appeared?

AW: I'm happy to take questions

MW: I want to mention exception unwinding it done twice: 1. find the catch 2. to unwind
AW: this is a choice not necessity
